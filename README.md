# Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study (drivvy tripdata)

## Introduction:
I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Specialization course and earned my Professional Certificate, and I have been tasked to complete a Capstone Project highlighting the technical skills I learned during the course. The case I chose to analyze for my Capstone Project is the Cyclistic bike-share case study- data was provided by drivvy tripdata.

## Background:
Cyclistic launched a bike-share offering service in 2016. It has grown to a fleet of over 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tagged and locked into a network of over 692 stations across Chicago. Cyclistic marketing has relied heavily on general awareness to drive patronage across customer segments. Cyclistic finance analyst believe annual members tends to be more profitable compared to casual riders. Lily Moreno the director of marketing believes there should be a means to convert casual riders to annual members to increase profitability, the clear goal is conversion of casual riders to annual members.

## Business task:
I have been tasked a junior analyst to create a report based on existing historical data to show how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bike-share services differently by providing analysis of the bike-share service, supporting my analysis with visualization and key findings as well as provide three top recommendations based on my analysis.

## Data Wrangling and Cleaning:
Data wrangling is an essential step in the data analysis process because the quality of the insights derived from data largely depends on the quality of the data itself. Wrangling ensures that data is accurate, complete, and formatted correctly, making it easier for analysts and data scientists to draw meaningful conclusions from it.

The dataset was sourced here. It consist of rider’s data for 12 months from January — December 2022. I will be doing a preliminary check on the dataset for proper understanding and data wrangling will be deployed so as to make sense of the analysis. Microsoft SQL Server Management studio will be used for analysis of the data and visualization will be presented using Power BI.
